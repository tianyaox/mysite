Dropbox and PythonAnywhere
==========================

How to sync folders between PythonAnywhere and your Dropbox

You need to *share* dropbox folders with our dropbox account.

First, make sure we know **what email address you use for dropbox** - if
this isn't the same as the email address you used to sign up with
PythonAnywhere, we can't guess who you are when the sharing invite
arrives in our inbox.

You'll find a link to modify your email address in the Files menu, at the top
of your screen.

Then, go to the Dropbox site and share a folder with dropbox@pythonanywhere.com

https://www.dropbox.com/share

You'll see the shared folder appear inside ~/Dropbox within a few minutes.

From that point on, any changes you make to that folder will be automatically
synced back to your Dropbox and vice-versa, just like the Dropbox folder
on your PC.
